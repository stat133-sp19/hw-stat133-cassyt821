#GSW Team Shots Report

##Introduction
This report examines and visualizes the shooting patterns of the starting lineup of the Golden State Warriors from the 2016-2017 season. By examining the data from their 2016-2017 season, we can pick out trends in attempted and made shots and make suggestions where to focus on training and in shooting in a game. \n
\n

##Motivation and Background
Stephen Curry is an outrageous 3-point shooter. He and Kevin Durant are the major play-makers. Klay Thompson is a major facilitator of plays and catch-and-shoot. Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green are two excellent defenders. Together, the five of them make up a Dream Team of a starting line-up and have propelled the Golden State Warriors to fame and success. Why are they successful, in terms of observable points? Where are there strengths, their weaknesses, and do these correspond well with their current positions? We should hope so, otherwise someone isn't doing their job. So let's check the coach's work, shall we?

##Data
Of 1250 shots, Curry has made 584. Of 915 shots, Durant has made 495. Of 578 shots, Green has made 245. Of 371 shots, Iguodala has made 192. Of 1220 shots, Thompson has made 575.

##Analysis and Discussion
It is plain to see that Andre Iguodala makes significantly fewer shots than the rest of the fantastic five. However, Iguodala has the second highest overall accuracy of the five of them, surpassed only by Kevin Durant. Although we do not have the defensive statistics on the players, we can infer who is primarily defensive and who is primarily offensive. Durant, Curry, and Thompson attempt and make the most points, in both the 2-point and 3-point views. We can see that Iguodala and Green are most likely defensive players, since they attempt fewer shots. \n

Iguodala has the tightest shots of the five, while Curry has the most dispersed shots. We can see that the defensively-inclined players take fewer shots on the outer rim and more just beneath the basket. This makes sense, since defensive players are typically taller, and it is easier for taller players to make dunks, just underneath the basket. We can see the offensive players' shots are spread out across the key and inside the 3-point line.

##Conclusion
We can each player's strengths are well suited to their assigned position. This is expected, since it would not make sense for a team to win if its players' strengths are not taken advantage of.
