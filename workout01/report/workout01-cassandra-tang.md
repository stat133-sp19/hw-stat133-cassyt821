GSW Team Shots Report
=====================

Introduction
------------

This report examines and visualizes the shooting patterns of the starting lineup of the Golden State Warriors from the 2016-2017 season. By examining the data from their 2016-2017 season, we can pick out trends in attempted and made shots and make suggestions where to focus on training and in shooting in a game.

Motivation and Background
-------------------------

Stephen Curry is an outrageous 3-point shooter. He and Kevin Durant are the major play-makers. Klay Thompson is a major facilitator of plays and catch-and-shoot. Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green are two excellent defenders. Together, the five of them make up a Dream Team of a starting line-up and have propelled the Golden State Warriors to fame and success. Why are they successful, in terms of observable points? Where are there strengths, their weaknesses, and do these correspond well with their current positions? We should hope so, otherwise someone isn't doing their job. So let's check the coach's work, shall we?

Analysis
--------

It is plain to see that Andre Iguodala makes significantly fewer shots than the rest of the fantastic five. However, Iguodala has the second highest overall accuracy of the five of them, surpassed only by Kevin Durant. Although we do not have the defensive statistics on the players, we can infer who is primarily defensive and who is primarily offensive. Curry has the most dispersion of shots, as visible in the
